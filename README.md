# Design-of-an-active-filter-circuit-to-process-a-noisy-analog-signal
The task is to process a noisy signal. The only information given is the frequency of the wanted signal, it is ftarget = 42 kHz. My task is to design a suitable filter circuit to extract this signal, a SNR of 30dB is required. There are several options to realize the requested filter circuit using active filter. For this assignment a PSpice project is provided by the Professor. The provided project contains a voltage source generating the noisy signal.
